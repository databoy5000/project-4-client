## World Crisis Response Organisation

by [RaphaÃ«lle Charrier](https://github.com/RaphaelleC) and [Anthony Graham](https://github.com/databoy5000/).

WoCRO is an app for Help-seekers (governmental entities) and NGOs to log major world crises into one place to collaborate efficently on solving them.

## Project Brief

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Approach
To guarantee continuity during the project build, we established the following elements:
* To assure communications on a messaging app where we could write, talk, exchange resources and share screens.
* [Project Management Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g-ZKAiVj09dBAaLHXUu5pl-V6kxmzfIp10CzKzqRgqc/view): to document the project scope and all specifications to the app into a single shared space.

Then, we defined the following milestones:
1. Establish database collections, their relationships and validated diagram.
2. Define API endpoints.
3. Construct wireframes.
4. Build cycle
    - Task planning/coordinating
    - Code
    - Test
    - Fix errors
    - Push working feature to GitHub
5. Syle completed components/pages
6. Final tests to validate app flow and design finishing
7. Backend & Frontend deployment

During the <ins>build cycle</ins>, we worked our way linearly from the back-end to the front-end, clearly defining tasks (one or multiple complete features per task) between team members to work through them separately in order to have minimum overlap, avoiding merge conflicts and/or work being done twice.

## Project Planning Diagrams

### <ins>Flow Chart</ins>
Setting the flow chart helped us to brainstorm our way from a few different ideas to a sustainable one, and allowing us to manage expectations during the build across the team.

### <ins>Entity Relationship Diagram</ins>
<center><img src="./screenshots/ERD.png" alt="ERD" width="600"></center>

### <ins>Wireframes</ins>
The wireframes include features which we thought could be part of our MVP. We quickly realised - whilst working our way through the back end - that we had to make things simpler to complete our MVP within the given deadline.

## Responsibilities
This project was a great team effort of bringing things together as a pair, but let's take a look at the elements which I configured...

### <ins>Back-end (crises app)</ins>

#### 1. Models
As set in the ERD, the following subclasses were built, inheriting from `django.db.models.Model` class (which allowed access to the class's attributes to create the database fields):
- Crisis
- Request
- Resource
- NGOResource

Some of the fields required to be guided through a selection of values. The documentation recommended we implement the following (e.g. `Crisis`):
```py
    TSUNAMI = 'Tsunami'
    HURRICANE = 'Hurricane'
    FLOOD = 'Flood'
    EARTHQUAKE = 'Earthquake'
    WAR = 'War'
    PANDEMIC = 'Pandemic'
    WILDFIRE = 'Wildfire'

    DISASTER_TYPES = [
        (TSUNAMI, 'Tsunami'),
        (HURRICANE, 'Hurricane'),
        (FLOOD, 'Flood'),
        (EARTHQUAKE, 'Earthquake'),
        (WAR, 'War'),
        (PANDEMIC, 'Pandemic'),
        (WILDFIRE, 'Wildfire')
    ]

    disaster_type = models.CharField(
        max_length=20,
        choices=DISASTER_TYPES,
    )
```

#### Views
#### Serialization
#### URLs

### <ins>Back-end (jwt_auth)</ins>


### <ins>Front-end</ins>
