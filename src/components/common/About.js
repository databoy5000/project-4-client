      <p className="lh-sm text-center m-4">Founded in 2021, the objective of WoRCO is to provide a platform for both NGOs and people in distress to communicate about the crisis they are facing.</p>

      <p className="lh-sm text-center m-4">For now we only allow one representative per country, but we plan on extending our service in the future so that more people can have access to it.</p>

      <p className="lh-sm text-center m-4">Let us all care for humanity together !</p>
